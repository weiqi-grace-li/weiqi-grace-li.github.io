I am a Master of Science student in Statistics with a minor in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University, advised by Prof. Yuan Jiang, and working closely with Prof. Xinzhou Ge. My research focuses on statistical and machine-learning methods for high-throughput sequencing and spatial omics data, with an emphasis on deriving biologically meaningful insights with translational potential.

I work extensively with spatial transcriptomics technologies (including Xenium, Visium, Slide-seq, etc) and have contributed to three main research directions:
  
  -	benchmarking cell-type-specific spatially variable gene (ctSVG) detection methods using a realistic and decomposable simulation framework,
 
  -	deep-learning models for predicting spatial gene expression from histology images,
  
  -	machine-learning approaches for cell-type annotation in single cell resolution spatial data.
  
Broadly, I am interested in statistical genomics and excited to explore diverse datasets and methodological challenges.
